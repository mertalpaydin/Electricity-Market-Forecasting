## Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Project Setup & Environment
- Created `.gitignore` (already existed and was configured).
- Created folders: `data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `models/`, `reports/`, `results/`.
- Generated `requirements.txt` with specified libraries.

### Phase 0.5.1: GPU Acceleration & VRAM Management Strategy
- Verified CUDA availability with `torch.cuda.is_available()`.

### Phase 0.5.2: Data Loading and Streaming Strategy
- Implemented a custom `IterableDataset` (`ElectricityPriceIterableDataset`) in `src/data_loader.py`.
- Integrated with `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` and `pytorch_lightning.LightningDataModule`.
- Updated the `IterableDataset` and `collate_fn` to yield a `past_observed_mask` for compatibility with transformer-based models.

### Phase 1: Data Exploration, Preprocessing, and Feature Engineering
- **Preprocessing Script (`src/preprocess.py`):**
    - Implemented robust feature engineering for time-based and cross-contract features.
    - Corrected the cross-contract feature implementation to be forward-looking safe and added new features (`close_lag_adj_k`, `close_delta_adj_k`, `volume_adj_k`, `nearest_liquid_contract_close`, `cross_contract_mean`).
    - Added the `time_to_delivery` feature.
    - Implemented data splitting and scaling.
- **Initial Data Loading and EDA (in `notebooks/01_EDA.ipynb`):**
    - Performed initial exploratory data analysis.
- **Documentation:**
    - Added comprehensive docstrings and comments to `src/data_loader.py`, `src/datamodule.py`, and `src/preprocess.py`.

### Phase 4: Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning
- Created a dedicated notebook (`notebooks/02_Hyperparameter_Tuning.py`) for hyperparameter optimization.
- Implemented asset subsampling based on liquidity (High, Medium, Low) for efficient tuning.
- Used **Optuna** to tune hyperparameters for `LSTM`, and `Chronos`.
- Saved the best performing hyperparameters to `results/best_hyperparameters.json`.
